**Zoning Analysis Script Overview**

This Python script performs spatial analysis to calculate zoning area statistics and counts the number of address points that intersect with each zoning classification. The results are written to a CSV file for further analysis or reporting.

**Key Features:**

Calculates the total area for each zoning classification in both square feet and acres.

Counts the number of address points (e.g., buildings or parcels) that intersect with each zoning area.

Outputs the results into a CSV file containing zoning class information, area sizes, and unit counts.

**Prerequisites**

ArcGIS Pro with ArcPy installed.

Pandas library installed for creating and exporting CSV files.

To install Pandas, use the following command:

bash
Copy
pip install pandas

**Inputs**

Zoning Layer (Polygon): A polygon feature layer that represents zoning areas. This layer should have a field specifying the zoning classification (e.g., residential, commercial, industrial).

Address Layer (Point): A point feature layer that represents address points or building locations within the zoning areas.

Zoning Classification Field: The field in the zoning layer that defines the zoning classification (e.g., zoning_type).

Output CSV Path: The file path where the CSV will be saved, containing the results of the analysis.

**Usage**

Set up the environment:
Ensure you have ArcGIS Pro installed and access to ArcPy. You also need Pandas for exporting results to CSV.

Running the script:
This script can be executed in ArcGIS Pro or from a Python IDE that has access to ArcPy and Pandas.

To run the script, simply execute it from your Python environment:

bash
Copy
python zoning_analysis.py

It will prompt you to provide the following parameters:

Zoning Layer: Path to the polygon layer containing zoning areas.

Address Layer: Path to the point layer containing addresses.

Zoning Classification Field: The field that contains the zoning classification (e.g., zone_type).

Output CSV Path: The location where the resulting CSV will be saved.

**Output:**

The script will generate a CSV file at the provided output location containing the following columns:

zone class: The zoning classification (e.g., Residential, Commercial).

sq ft: The total area in square feet.

acres: The total area in acres.

units per area allowed: (Optional, can be calculated based on zoning rules).

calc units allowed: (Optional, calculated based on specific zoning rules).

units per area existing: The number of address points (units) within the zoning area.

diff units: The difference between the allowed units and existing units (if calculated).

**Example Command Line Input**

When running the script via command line, the prompt will request the following inputs:

Zoning Layer (Polygon): C:/path/to/zoning_layer.shp

Address Layer (Point): C:/path/to/address_points.shp

Zoning Classification Field: zoning_type

Output CSV: C:/path/to/output/results.csv

**Output Example (CSV)**

The resulting CSV file will have the following columns:


zone class	    sq ft	    acres	    units per area allowed	    calc units allowed	    units per area existing	      diff units
Residential	    50000.0	  1.14	              10	                    15	                      8	                         7
Commercial	    100000.0	2.30	              20	                    25	                      15	                       10

**How the Script Works**

Get Parameters: The script starts by receiving the input parameters for the zoning and address layers, the zoning classification field, and the output CSV path.

Zoning Class Analysis: The script fetches all unique zoning classifications from the zoning layer and processes each classification individually.

Area Calculation: For each zoning class, the script calculates the total area (in square feet and acres) of the zoning area.

Count Address Points: The script selects address points that intersect the zoning area and counts the number of points for each zoning class.

CSV Output: The results, including zoning class, area, and address point counts, are stored in a CSV file for further use.

**Modifications and Customizations**

You can modify the script to calculate units per area allowed based on specific zoning regulations or formulas.

The script can be adapted to filter specific zoning types or address types for further analysis.

**Troubleshooting**

ArcPy Errors: Ensure that you are using a valid version of ArcGIS Pro and that ArcPy is installed correctly. This script requires ArcPy to interact with GIS data.

Invalid Shapefile Paths: Make sure that the paths to the shapefiles for the zoning and address layers are correct and accessible.

Python Environment: The script requires Python 2.7 (for ArcGIS) or Python 3.x (for standalone use with ArcGIS API for Python). Ensure that all dependencies (ArcPy and Pandas) are installed in your environment.

**Licensing**

This script is designed for use with ArcGIS Pro and is licensed under the Esri license. Ensure you have access to the necessary tools in your environment.
